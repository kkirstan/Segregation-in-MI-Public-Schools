          <h1>Free and Reduced Lunch Eligibility by School District in MI</h1>
        </div>

        <p>Historically, Detroit has been known as one of the most segregated metropolitan areas in the United States, with other large Michigan cities such as Grand Rapids, Flint, Saginaw, Muskegon, and Kalamazoo falling not too far behind. These divisions along lines of race and socioeconomic status create distinct patterns in where people live, attend school, and work. </p>
        <p>Following these patterns, Michigan's school system is highly divided along lines of race and socioeconomic status. Eligibility for free and reduced-priced meals through the National School Lunch Program is a good indicator of socioeconomic status, as it reveals the number of children living at or below the poverty level. When student body eligibility within Michigan school districts for free and reduced-priced meals is examined, school districts with the highest eligibility are most often located in inner-city areas and disproportionately comprised of majority-minority students.</p>
        <p>Out of 510 total school districts in Michigan, only 55 have a student body comprised primarily of minority students (meaning the percentage of caucasian students in the student body is less than 50%), yet 48 of these majority-minority districts have 2/3 or more student body eligibility for free and reduced-priced meals. Alternatelty, only 16.7% of majority-caucasian school districts, compared to 87.3% of majority-minority school districts, have a student body with free and reduced-priced meal eligibility at 2/3 or greater. Even further, 53 out of the 55 majority-minority districts in Michigan have 50% student body eligibility for free and reduced-priced meals, indicating that nearly 1 in 2 children in majority-minority districts in Michigan are living at or below the poverty level.</p>
        <p>The graphic below displays markers identifying the central location of each school district in Michigan, with color coordinating to free and reduced-priced meal eligibility. Green markers indicate low eligibility, with 33% or less of the student body qualifying. Yellow markers indicate moderate eligibility, between 33-66%. Red markers indicate high eligibility, over 66%. Purple markers indicates school districts with high eligibility (>66%) and a student body comprised primarily of minority students.</p>
