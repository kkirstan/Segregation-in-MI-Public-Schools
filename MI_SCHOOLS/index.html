        <p>Historically, Detroit has been known as one of the most segregated metropolitan areas in the United States, with other large Michigan cities such as Grand Rapids, Flint, Saginaw, Muskegon, and Kalamazoo falling not too far behind. These divisions along lines of race and socioeconomic status create distinct patterns in where people live, attend school, and work. </p>
        <p>Following these patterns, Michigan's school system is highly divided along lines of race and socioeconomic status. Eligibility for free and reduced-priced meals through the National School Lunch Program is a good indicator of socioeconomic status, as it reveals the number of children living at or below the poverty level. When student body eligibility within Michigan schools for free and reduced-priced meals is examined, schools with the highest eligibility are most often located in inner-city areas and disproportionately comprised of majority-minority students.</p>
        <p>Out of 2833 total schools in Michigan, only 669 have a student body comprised primarily of minority students (meaning the percentage of caucasian students in the student body is less than 50%). Yet, 555 of these majority-minority schools have 2/3 or greater student body eligibility for free and reduced-priced meals. Alternatelty, only 20% of majority-caucasian schools, compared to 83% of majority-minority schools, have a student body with free and reduced-priced meal eligibility at 2/3 or greater. This suggests that majority-minority schools are 4 times more likely than their white counterparts to have high student body eligibility for free and reduced-price meals. indicating that more than 1 in 2 children attending majority-minority schools in Michigan are living at or below the poverty level.</p>
        <p>The graphic above displays markers identifying the location of each school in Michigan, with color coordinating to free and reduced-priced meal eligibility. When the "All Schools" filter is selected, green markers indicate low eligibility, with 33% or less of the student body qualifying. Yellow markers indicate moderate eligibility, between 33-66%. Red markers indicate high eligibility, over 66%. When the "Majority-Minority" filter is selected, blue markers indicate schools with a student body comprised primarily of minority students. When the "Demographics" filter is selected, red markers indicate majority-caucasian schools, while blue markers indicate majority-minority schools. When an individual marker is selected, a pie chart displays a demographic breakdown of each school.</p>
